# quiltR
Code to design quilts in R. This is work in progress and needs more documentation.

See the [polygon_making.R]("polygon_making.R") script or the [make_random_fpp.R]("make_random_fpp.R") script.

Also documented at https://awalsh17.github.io/posts/2022-03-24-quilting-with-r/

## Notes

Features in progress:

* Match to Kona Solids and Art Gallery Fabrics by color
* Plan the yardage of each color needed
* Complete the other design types (2-point perspective polygons, pixelated image, random FPP)
* Allow for hand selection of block shapes and not a uniform grid
* Add example results
